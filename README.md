# Netflix-Content-Insights (Interactive Dashboard using MS Excel)

## Summary  
An interactive Excel dashboard that uncovers Netflix’s content trends across age groups, release years, genres, and countries, presented with clean visuals and engaging charts.  

## Overview  
This project analyzes Netflix’s catalog to understand how titles are spread across different years, genres, countries, and age groups. The dashboard makes it easy to see which years had the most releases, which genres dominate the platform, and how content is divided for different audiences. Clear charts and slicers are used so the information is simple to explore and visually appealing.  

## Problem Statement  
Netflix has thousands of titles, but it’s hard to understand the big picture just by looking at raw data. Questions like Which year had the most releases? Which genres are popular? Which country adds the most content? are not easy to answer. This dashboard turns the data into simple visuals that give clear answers.
