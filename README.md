# Netflix-Content-Insights (Interactive Dashboard using MS Excel)

## Summary  
An interactive Excel dashboard that uncovers Netflix’s content trends across age groups, release years, genres, and countries, presented with clean visuals and engaging charts.  

## Overview  
This project analyzes Netflix’s catalog to understand how titles are spread across different years, genres, countries, and age groups. The dashboard makes it easy to see which years had the most releases, which genres dominate the platform, and how content is divided for different audiences. Clear charts and slicers are used so the information is simple to explore and visually appealing.
